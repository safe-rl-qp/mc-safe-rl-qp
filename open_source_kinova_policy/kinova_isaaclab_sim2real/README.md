# ü¶æ Kinova Gen3 RL & Sim2Real Toolkit

## Overview

This repository provides a modular framework for training reinforcement learning (RL) agents on the **Kinova Gen3** robot using **Isaac Lab**, and deploying trained models either in **Isaac Sim**, or on the **real robot** via ROS2.

Built as a standalone Isaac Lab extension, it allows isolated development.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Sim2Real pipeline runs entirely with **ROS2** and does **not require Isaac Lab or Isaac Sim** to be installed. And for convenience, **pre-trained models are provided** so you can get started immediately without training.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Install Isaac Lab by following the official [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html) (conda recommended).  
2. Clone this repo **outside** the `IsaacLab` directory.  
3. Install from the repository:

```bash
python -m pip install -e source/gen3
```

## üöÄ Training & Basic Testing

You can train a policy on the Kinova Gen3 **Reach Task** using either `rsl_rl` or `rl_games` library:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --task Gen3-Reach-v0
```

After training, a quick way to validate the behavior is to use `play.py`:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/play.py --task Gen3-Reach-v0
```

This helps confirm that the learned policy performs as expected in **Isaac Lab** before attempting transfer.

## ü§ñ Sim2Real Deployment (ROS2)

The Sim2Real pipeline focuses on deploying trained reinforcement learning policies directly onto the **real Kinova Gen3 robot** using a minimal **ROS2-based interface**, with no dependency on Isaac Lab or Isaac Sim at runtime.

### Fake-hardware test

You can first try to simulate the Kinova Gen3 in ROS2 using fake hardware mode:

```bash
ros2 launch kortex_bringup gen3.launch.py robot_ip:=yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy use_fake_hardware:=true
```

To test movement commands, send a simple joint trajectory:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /joint_trajectory_controller/joint_trajectory trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory "{
  joint_names: [joint_1, joint_2, joint_3, joint_4, joint_5, joint_6, joint_7],
  points: [
    { positions: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], time_from_start: { sec: 1 } },
  ]
}" -1
```

Run the Reach Task with the trained policy to go to a certain predefined position:

```bash
python3 scripts/sim2real/run_task_reach.py
```

### Real robot test

The next step is to connect the same interface to the **real Kinova Gen3** and execute the learned Reach Task in real-world conditions ‚Äî using the exact same model and runtime logic validated in simulation.

For that you'll run:

```bash
ros2 launch kortex_bringup gen3_lite.launch.py robot_ip:=192.168.1.10
```

And in the same way as simulation, in another terminal:

```bash
python3 scripts/sim2real/run_task_reach.py
```

Now your robot should be alternating between three positions.
