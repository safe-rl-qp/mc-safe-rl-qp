<p>These objects represent constraints that can be added to the solver.</p>

<p>They can be loaded from C++ with the following code:</p>

<div class="card bg-light card-source">
  <div class="card-body">
{% highlight cpp %}
// Access the constraint set loader
#include <mc_solver/ConstraintSetLoader.h>

// Get the constraint from a JSON file
auto constraint = mc_solver::ConstraintSetLoader::load(solver(), "/my/path/constraint.json");

// Get the constraint from a YAML file
auto constraint = mc_solver::ConstraintSetLoader::load(solver(), "/my/path/constraint.yaml");

// Actually you can get the constraint from any mc_rtc::Configuration entry
auto constraint = mc_solver::ConstraintSetLoader::load(solver(), config("constraint"));

// In all the cases above, constraint is an std::shared_ptr<mc_solver::ConstraintSet>
// but you can retrieve a more precise type, mc_rtc will check that the constraints
// that was retrieved from disk is compatible with the constraint you requested
auto constraint = mc_solver::ConstraintSetLoader::load<mc_solver::BoundedSpeedConstr>(solver(), config("constraint"));
{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
</div>

<p>This page shows what data is expected for each constraint available in mc_rtc.</p>
