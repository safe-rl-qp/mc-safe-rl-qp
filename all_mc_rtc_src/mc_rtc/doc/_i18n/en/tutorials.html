  <h1>Tutorials</h1>

  <p>Welcome to mc_rtc tutorials. You will hopefully find useful information on this page to get started with the framework and use it to its full extent.</p>

  <p>mc_rtc is a super-set of the {% link SpaceVecAlg %}, {% link RBDyn %} and {% link Tasks %} libraries which provides a friendlier and easier interface for the user. You can write your controller code either in C++ or Python. When applicable, examples will be provided in both languages.</p>

  <p>The tutorials presented here assume some familiarity with the {% link SpaceVecAlg %} and {% link RBDyn %} libraries as well as a basic understanding of QP-based control such as implemented in {% link Tasks %}. Unfamiliar users can refer to the {% link SpaceVecAlg and RBDyn presentations %} and the {% link SpaceVecAlg and RBDyn tutorials %} by Joris Vaillant.</p>
