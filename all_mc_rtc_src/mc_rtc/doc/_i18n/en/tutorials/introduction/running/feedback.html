<h4>Getting feedback and interacting with the controller</h4>

<p>If mc_rtc is built with ROS support and the correct options are activated, you can visualize the controller's output using RViZ and interact with it through the dedicated RViZ panel. Follow the mc_rtc_ticker tutorial to find out how to launch RViZ.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can still build {% link mc_rtc_ros %} without ROS if you have the {% link Qt %} library. After installing, simply run the following command:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ mc_rtc_gui
{% endhighlight %}
