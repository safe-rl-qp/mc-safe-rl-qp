<h4>Pre-requisites</h4>

<p>To run this interface you need to have installed {% link mc_openrtm %} on your system. Furthermore, you will need {% link Choreonoid %} and a related simulation file for your robot. An example is provided for JVRC-1.</p>

<h4>Running the controller</h4>

<p>Open the simulation file with Choreonoid. For example, using the JVRC example provided with {% link mc_openrtm %}:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# Go to the directory where the simulation file has been installed
$ cd /usr/local/share/hrpsys/samples/JVRC1
# Restart omniNames services
$ ./clear-omninames.sh
# Open the simulation file
$ choreonoid sim_mc.cnoid
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Then click the button to start the simulation in Choreonoid. This will also start your controller. Note that you can directly start the simulation from the command line:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ choreonoid sim_mc.cnoid --start-simulation
{% endhighlight %}

{% translate_file tutorials/introduction/running/feedback.html %}

<p>Note: this won't enable 3D visualization beyond what is available in Choreonoid</p>
