###
# Stabilizer MetaTask configuration
#
# This task is initialized in the following order:
# - Default configuration is loaded from the
#   robot module (gains, default surface names, joint names, etc).
# - Then general configuration is loaded from this YAML task configuration
# - Then robot-specific configuration is loaded from the `robot_name` group
#   in which you may override any of the previous configuration
#
# In most cases, the user will not need to care about the general stabilizer configuration,
# and is only expected to provide information about how the statbilizer is meant to be used:
# - contacts: list of established contacts (one of [Left, Right])
#   By default the current estimated contact surface pose from the real robot
#   is used as the reference contact frame. You may override this behaviour by providing
#   `Left` or `Right` entries with the desired contact targets.
#
# The JSON example shows such a simple configuration
###
# More complete example with most of the possible configurations.
# See the JSON schema for a full list of available members
#
# Note: than in practice, most users will not need to provide
# all these configuration parameters as the default
# should be good-enough in most use-cases.
#
# Note2: the gains provided here are just meant as an example on how to override
# the default gains with your own, do not expect those to behave well.
# Please refer to the RobotModule for valid default gains.
