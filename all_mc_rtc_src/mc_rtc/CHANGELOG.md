## [1.11.0] - 2022-07-08

### Highlights

`mc_rbdyn::Frame` and `mc_rbdyn::RobotFrame` have been introduced. This removes
the unnecessary distinction between bodies and surfaces that has existed in the
framework. (#247)

### API breaks

- `mc_rbdyn::Robots` cannot be created directly anymore, one has to go through
   a factory function (#247)
- `mc_rbdyn::Robots` stores indiviual robot as pointer and in particular
  `robots.robots()` returns a self reference instead of `vector<Robot>`,
  `Robots` behaves a little more like a vector now to mitigate the impact of this
  change (#247)
- `EndEffectorTask` and co. cannot use a `bodyPoint` in their constructor anymore, proper frames should be used instead (#247)
- `VectorOrientationTask` and co. cannot set or get the `bodyVector` after the fact anymore (#247)

### Deprecations

- Usage of `body` or `surface` in JSON/YAML is deprecated in favor of frame,
  the doc will only show `frame` but it should continue to work with all old
  JSON/YAML files (#247)
- Idem for specifications of relative targets (#247)

### Changes

- [mc_control] Controllers can specify different `init_pos` for different `MainRobot` (#251)
- [mc_rbdyn] Add an overload to load a robot module with a custom name
- [mc_rtc_utils] `mc_rtc::shared` is a wrapper around `std::enabled_shared_from_this` to allow
  reference-style API where the data is backed by a shared pointer (#247)
- [mc_tasks] All tasks (when it makes sense) can accept a frame at construction (#247)
- [mc_solver] `mc_solver::BoundedSpeedConstr` can be used to constraint a frame velocity (#247)
- [mc_solver] Active joints in a collision can be specified via `mc_rbdyn::Collision` objects (#262)
- [utils] `build_and_install` now supports Ubuntu Jammy (22.04) (#248)
- [utils] `build_and_install` can now install the Panda module (#249)

- [mc_rbdyn] `RobotModule::init(rbd::parsers::ParserResult)` does not overwrite the reference joint order if it was already provided
